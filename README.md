The application team has developed a new algorithm for finding the most suitable profiles. To test the algorithm's performance, an A/B test was conducted. All users were divided into two groups.
Users in group 0 used the application with the old algorithm, while all users in group 1 used the application with the new algorithm for profile matching.
The task is to evaluate whether the new algorithm has indeed improved the quality of the service. To achieve this, it is necessary to choose metrics that reflect the service's quality and statistically compare these metrics between the two groups.

The data includes logs of user interactions with each other. For each user pair, their A/B test group is specified, along with whether they had a match.
The outcome of the analysis should be a conclusion with an answer to the question of whether it is advisable to deploy the new profile matching system to all users.
